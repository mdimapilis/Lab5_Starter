## Check your Understanding

1. You would not use a unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application because this is a component that interacts on the whole application level.
2. You can use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature because each message is individual and their length varies. You can test this on a small scale and execute it quickly.
